# The following phases are often inferred correctly by Nixpacks for a Node.js project
# with a package.json. You can uncomment and customize if needed.

# [phases.install]
# cmds = ["npm install --legacy-peer-deps"] # Added --legacy-peer-deps just in case, can remove if not needed

# [phases.build]
# cmds = ["npm run build"] # Assumes tsc compilation via `npm run build`

# [start]
# cmd = "npm run start" # Assumes `node dist/index.js` via `npm run start`
